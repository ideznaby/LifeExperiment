# LifeExperiment
This project which I call it life experiment is a very simple simulation of world. This world is consist of food which distributed randomly and some creatures. Every creature has it's own mind which is a simple neural network and has random number of neurons.
These creatures are placed randomly on this world without any knowledge about it and they eventually learn to find food and eat it.
Also they learn to attack,kill and eat each other.
Creatures have a satisfaction method which calculates the satisfaction of the creature based on its distance from food, other creatures and its energy.
The only thing that the creatures know is that they want to increase their satisfaction.
This project had a lot of interesting results for example it showed that the environment is more important than IQ (at least in this model) because also high IQ creatures usually last longer than others but the ones that been in a good environment with high amount of food or a lot of contentions tend to last the longest.
This project is written in C# and I used BrainNet Library for creating it.
